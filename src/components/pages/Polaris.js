          Polaris is a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa
          Minor. It is designated Î± Ursae Minoris (Latinized to Alpha Ursae
          Minoris) and is commonly called the North Star or Pole Star.The
          temperature of Polaris varies by only a small amount during its
          pulsations, but the amount of this variation is variable and
          unpredictable. The erratic changes of temperature and the amplitude of
          temperature changes during each cycle, from less than 50 K to at least
          170 K, may be related to the orbit with Polaris Ab.{" "}
