  }}>Polaris is a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Minor. It is designated Î± Ursae Minoris (Latinized to Alpha Ursae Minoris) and is commonly called the North Star or Pole Star.The temperature of Polaris varies by only a small amount during its pulsations, but the amount of this variation is variable and unpredictable. The erratic changes of temperature and the amplitude of temperature changes during each cycle, from less than 50 K to at least 170 K, may be related to the orbit with Polaris Ab. </h1>
